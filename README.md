# 🌱 Krishi Sahyog – Smart Farming Assistant

**Krishi Sahyog** is a region-based web platform designed to help farmers make smarter agricultural decisions. It allows users to select their area, choose crops based on seasonal availability, and get complete insights on crop requirements, spacing, and estimated profit — all tailored to their selected region.

### 🧭 How It Works

1. **📍 Area Selection:**  
   The user begins by selecting a district. Currently, only **Hassan** and its sub-districts are supported in the prototype.

2. **🌾 Crop Recommendation by Season:**  
   Based on the selected area, the system filters and displays crops that are suitable for the current season.

3. **📋 Crop Requirements:**  
   Once a crop is selected, the user is shown essential requirements for growing that crop successfully — including water needs, soil type, and fertilizer details.

4. **📏 Spacing Calculator:**  
   The user can enter their land area, and the system will calculate ideal plant spacing to optimize the field layout.

5. **💰 Profit Estimator:**  
   Based on the entered area and selected crop, the platform estimates potential profit to help farmers plan ahead.
